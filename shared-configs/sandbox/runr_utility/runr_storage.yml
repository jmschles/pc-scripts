# if working on several apps and running test at same time,
# could be good to run 2 servers on 6380 for development & 6379 for test
# For regular setup, message and admin both run on one server accessible by all apps
# and session is running on a separate server accessible by a cluster of same apps running in parallel

# For staging-sf adjust to your hostname
# Duplicate this file and remove "sample_" from the name
